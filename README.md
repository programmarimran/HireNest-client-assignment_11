## 📌 Overview

**HireNest** is a full-stack service marketplace web application where users can **offer** their services and **hire** others. It provides a secure, role-based environment with real-time service booking, dynamic dashboards, and a modern UI experience. This project is part of my portfolio and fulfills assignment criteria for a full-stack development course.
